Installation
============

`Python3`_ and a C-compiler are needed to build the
underlying libraries. Install the package using 
`pip`_ with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install maicos

or using `conda`_ with:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge maicos 

Alternatively, if you don't have special privileges, install
the package only for the current using the ``--user`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install --user maicos

To find out more about the use of MAICoS, first have a look at our 
`Usage pages` for a general introduction or at the 
:ref:`userdoc-how-to` if you already know how MAICoS work and you want to 
solve a specific problem. For each module, parameters
are listed in the :ref:`userdoc-analysis-modules` subsection.
