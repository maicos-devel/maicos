        "\n# Ideal component of the chemical potential\n\n## What is the chemical potential?\n\nMolecular dynamics simulations are often performed with a constant number of particles.\nWhen modelling confined systems in molecular dynamics simulations, it is often assumed\nthat the confined geometry extends infinitely, while real systems have a finite size and\nare connected to a reservior many times larger than the confined space.\n\nIn this case, the number of particles in the system is not constant, but changes over\ntime. This can be seen as a system that is exchanging particles with a reservoir. The\nchemical potential describes how the free energy changes when particles are added to (or\nremoved from) the system. The chemical potential is therefore a very important quantity\nin molecular dynamics simulations of confined systems.\n\nIf you want to know more about what the chemical potential means you can take a look at\nthe references below :footcite:p:`UnderstandingChemicalPotential`.\n\n## How to calculate the ideal component of the chemical potential\n\nThe chemical potential can be split up into different parts\n\n\\begin{align}\\mu = \\mu^0 + \\mu^\\text{ideal} + \\mu^\\text{excess},\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\mu^0$ represents the standard potential of the substance,\n$\\mu^\\text{ideal}$ represents the component of the potential that would also occur\nfor an ideal gas and $\\mu^\\text{excess}$ represents the excess contribution\ngenerated from the interactions between the particles. In the following calculations we\nare only interested in the ideal component.\n\nFor our case, we can calculate the ideal component of the potential according to\n\n\\begin{align}\\mu^\\text{ideal} = R T \\ln \\left( \\rho \\Lambda^3 \\right),\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\Lambda = \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{m \\cdot k_\\mathrm{B} \\cdot T}}$ is the\nthermal De-Broglie wavelength, i.e. the mean De-Broglie wavelength at temperature\n$T$. Furthermore, $m$ is the mass of the particles and $\\rho$ is the\nmean density of the system. The mean density can be calculated with MAICoS by using the\nDensity modules. We will exemplify this in the following example using the\n:class:`maicos.DensityPlanar` module.\n\nFirst we'll import every module we need.\n"
